# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This Flutter mobile application provides users with a comprehensive self-assessment tool to determine their Ayurvedic body constitution type (Prakriti). The app guides users through a structured questionnaire covering physical traits, mental/emotional behavior, daily habits, and environmental preferences. Based on their responses, the app analyzes which of the three doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) is most dominant and provides personalized wellness recommendations including diet, lifestyle, and stress management advice.
