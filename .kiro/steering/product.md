# Product Overview

## Ayurvedic Prakriti Assessment App

A Flutter mobile application that provides users with a comprehensive self-assessment tool to determine their Ayurvedic body constitution type (Prakriti). The app guides users through a structured questionnaire covering physical traits, mental/emotional behavior, daily habits, and environmental preferences.

### Core Features

- **Assessment Journey**: 40-50 questions across 4 categories (Physical Traits, Mental & Emotional, Habits & Preferences, Environmental Reactions)
- **Dosha Analysis**: Calculates dominant dosha(s) from Vata, Pitta, and Kapha based on user responses
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides tailored wellness advice for diet, lifestyle, sleep, and stress management
- **Offline Functionality**: Complete assessment and analysis without internet connection
- **Results History**: Save and access previous assessment results locally
- **Wellness Focus**: Clean, engaging UI with dosha-themed visuals and both light/dark modes

### Target Experience

The app should feel like a wellness journey rather than a clinical form, with engaging visuals, smooth animations, and an intuitive interface that guides users through their Ayurvedic constitution discovery.
